## Open Science Philosophy

I focus on making cutting-edge AI research accessible through systematic reproduction and practical applications, bridging the gap between theoretical advances and real-world implementations.

## Featured Projects

### AI Papers Reproduction
**Repository**: [awesome-ai-papers-reproduction](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/awesome-ai-papers-reproduction)

Collaborative project for systematically reproducing research papers from top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI).

**Key Features:**
- Standardized methodology with comprehensive documentation
- Efficient implementations optimized for practical deployment
- Multi-domain coverage: time series forecasting, computer vision, and NLP

**Current Reproductions:**
- **MoLE (Mixture of Linear Experts)**: Time series forecasting with ECL dataset
- **XPatch**: AAAI 2025 time series forecasting paper
- **Future Scope**: Computer vision, reinforcement learning, and NLP papers

### TGI-Writer: AI-Powered Educational Tool
**Repository**: [TGI-Writer](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/TGI-Writer)

AI writing assistant designed for standardized test preparation (TOEFL, GRE, IELTS).

**Technical Innovation:**
- Real-time analysis using GPT-4o-mini across 6 comprehensive panels
- Test-specific writing prompts and scoring based on official rubrics
- Mobile-first responsive interface with intuitive user experience

**Impact & Features:**
- Comprehensive feedback: errors, strengths, vocabulary, structure, test tips
- 30-minute countdown timer simulating real test conditions
- Open source with MIT license ensuring accessibility

### LLM Gaming Intelligence
**Repository**: [llm-play-games](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/llm-play-games)

Research platform exploring AI strategic capabilities through intelligent gaming systems.

**Research Focus:**
- Multi-model comparison: GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini performance analysis
- Strategic AI: intelligent decision-making in classic games
- Human-AI interaction: comprehensive evaluation of AI vs human gameplay

**Key Findings:**
- Gomoku performance: GPT-4o achieves 100:0 win rate against GPT-4o-mini
- Human challenge: humans achieve 9.1% win rate against GPT-4o
- Cultural games: successful implementation of Chinese Idiom Chain
